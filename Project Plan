I have hand recorded information unto an excel spreadsheet. The data supplied are reciepts collected by a client for 6 months. The client is seeking answers about how much money has been spent from August 2022 to Feburay 2023
Questions

Top 5 stores where the money was spent
Top 2 used Payment methods
Top 3 items brought at each store
Once all data is reviewed, these projections will show the spending habits, amounts, and how one retail organzation can control the flow of this clients income.
